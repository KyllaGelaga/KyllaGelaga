### ðŸš€ Skills and Experience  
My team developed an **early fraud detection system** using **Isolation Forest** on **2M+ rows of data accumulated over ~3 years**. By integrating a **Tableau dashboard**, we reduced manual review time from **3 days to 3 hours**. The **machine learning model** identified **key characteristics of fraudulent activities**, enabling analysts to focus on high-risk cases while potentially saving **up to $960K** in incurred costs.  

### ðŸŒ± What I'm working on:  
- Data science projects focusing on **analytics, visualization, and reporting**  
- Exploring **market analysis** through **consumer behavior insights and trend forecasting**
